## Why do we use prompt words


- ‚ù§Ô∏è ** Obtaining Necessary Answers * *: In most cases, the questions we ask may not yield the desired results due to the lack of scenarios, and we need to do more questioning. Hint words can help us quickly locate different scenarios and obtain information more accurately



- ‚úàÔ∏è ** Simplify the process * *: This project provides prompt word retrieval service to quickly find the desired scene, and also provides Chinese English translation and one click copy function



- üíª ** Improve productivity * *: We have made some optimizations to prompt words to obtain information more accurately



- üéì ** Easy to use * *: Beginner, just copy and paste with slight modifications to use



- üÜï ** Regular updates * *: We will update prompt words regularly



- üì¶ ** Ready to use out of the box * *:< https://aixiaolei.github.io/aigc-act2prompt/ >

### üí¨ Language switching



By default, the prompt content will be displayed in Chinese. If you want to read English, please click on the "CN" button




## ü§î common problem



### Why is Chinese sometimes inaccurate?



This is because AI has a better understanding of English compared to Chinese. Even the first conversational large-scale language model in China, MOSS, acknowledges that its English response level is higher than that of Chinese, and it is recommended to use English.




### Need to input Prompt every time?



ChatGPT can set global context without entering prompt every time, but in new binding, prompt needs to be set every time a new topic is opened (although new binding is free)




### Output false information



The answers of the big language model may sometimes have errors, and you need to carefully identify them yourself. Here, I recommend using multiple projects to verify each other to simply verify the authenticity of the answers.



### Hint words are not easy to use



This prompt word comes from the internet. If you find it difficult to use, you can go to< https://github.com/Aixiaolei/aigc-act2prompt/issues >I will revise your question as soon as possible.
