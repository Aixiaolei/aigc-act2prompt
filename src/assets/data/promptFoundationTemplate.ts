        "remark": "文本分类是一种技术，​它可以让模型将文本分成不同的类别。​这种技术对于自然语言处理、​文本分析和情感分析等任务非常有用。​ 需要注意的是，​文本分类和情感分析是不同的。​情感分析特别关注于确定文本中表达的情感或情绪。​这可能包括确定文本表达了积极、​消极还是中性的情感。​情感分析通常用于客户评论、​社交媒体帖子和其他需要表达情感的文本。​ 要在ChatGPT中使用文本分类提示，​模型需要提供一段文本，​并要求它根据预定义的类别或标签进行分类。​提示还应包括有关所需输出的信息，​例如类别或标签的数量以及任何特定的要求或约束。​",

        "desc_en": "Perform text classification on the following customer comments [insert comments] and classify them into different categories such as electronics, clothing, and furniture based on their content.",
        "remark_en": "Text classification is a technique that allows a model to categorize text into different classes. This technique is very useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text analysis, and sentiment analysis. It is important to note that text classification is different from sentiment analysis, which focuses specifically on determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text. This may include determining whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is often used for customer reviews, social media posts, and other text that expresses emotions. To use text classification prompts in ChatGPT, the model needs to be provided with a piece of text and asked to classify it into predefined categories or labels. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the number of categories or labels and any specific requirements or constraints.",

Text generation prompts can be used to fine-tune pre-trained models or train new models to perform specific tasks.",
